        <p class = "header-content">XiaoQiang Richard is a Chinese-immigrant that works in IT for an insurance company. He immigrated to Canada in 1997 after living in Hong Kong and later the United States for work. Canada ended up being the place to settle with his wife, Vivian Rong, thanks to the ‘IT Bubble’. How significant do professions continue to impact the immigration processes in North America today?</p><br>

        <p class = "header-content">Christopher Ma is a fourth-year at Queen’s University studying Commerce. He spent his childhood mostly in Canada, occasionally visiting China to see his grandparents. Chris’s understanding of Chinese identity has evolved at different points in time and settings. He links quarrels with his parents about education as a result of his parent’s upbringing in China and ultimately his Chinese, ethnic identity. Can this be appropriately associated with being Chinese or is this a misalignment of individual experience with cultural influence?</p>

        <p class = "header-content">Vivian Rong is a Chinese-immigrant that works in entrepreneurship, property, and art. She immigrated to Canada in 1999, after a prolonged long-distance relationship with her husband XiaoQiang Richard Ma. She reflects on the unique nature of how their love story turned to an immigration story. Like many other interviewees, the difficulty of living away from her own parents was identified as the singular drawback to her immigration. Was Vivian and her husband’s romance worth the dissonance with her parents and ‘true home’?</p>
