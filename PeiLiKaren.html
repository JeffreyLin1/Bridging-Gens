        <p class = "header-content">Karen is a current eleventh grade student attending school in Toronto. 
            While born here, she spent her early childhood studying in China. 
            It was not until [insert year] that her and her mother decided to move back to Toronto.
            Her father continues to stay in China for work.
            Karen felt that her educational prospects would be better in Canada.
            Karen has been positively influenced by her parents’ unconditional support,
            something she feels is fairly rare within the Chinese community. 
            She also describes how language and having a different (multicultural) upbringing 
            has not posed any challenges in her relationship with her parents. 
            Could this be because of Karen’s experience in both China and Canada, 
            allowing her to have a high proficiency in both her parent’s first language, Mandarin, and English?
            Or is this a real reflection of how language barriers are nothing in the eye of familial love?

        <p class = "header-content">Pei Li is a Chinese-immigrant that works as an executive at a pension company. She immigrated in 2010, describing the decision as a want to explore new cultures and languages. Regretless and glad to have discovered new things, how might her strong acceptance towards new principles affect her daughter, Karen’s own acceptance to differences. </p>
