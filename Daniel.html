        <p class = "header-content">Daniel is a current eleventh-grade student in Toronto. He was born and raised in Canada after his parents moved in 2001 and 2002. In his interview, he describes how his parents' Chinese-identity impacts their views on social issues, sometimes opposing his own. When asked to describe his approach to disagreements, he said, “I respect them for their opinions, and I guess they respect my opinions too. So, it’s okay.” While Daniel may have the privilege to agree-to-disagree with his parents on social issues now, how will his current approach work in the long run? Can he and his parents always politely disagree or are different perspectives from different cultures destined to escalate?
