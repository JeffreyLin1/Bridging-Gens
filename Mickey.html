        <p class = "header-content">Mickey is an entrepreneur and businessman. He immigrated to Canada to study at the University of Toronto. After graduation, he decided to stay in Canada out of ambition to make a name for himself outside of the aid from his parents. His restaurant, Terre Rouge Craft Kitchen, located downtown Markham, is one of the many projects he has involved himself in since. He had been settling in well until the pandemic hit. His chances of seeing his parents again, who lived in China, seemed slim to none. How has the pandemic influenced the experiences of recent immigrants?
