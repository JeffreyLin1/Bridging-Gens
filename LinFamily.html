        <p class = "header-content">Peng is an entrepreneur and businessman. He immigrated with his wife, Jamie, and three children, Nicholas, Isabella and Eva. Having lived both in Europe, China, and now Canada, Peng was previously exposed to the multi-cultural environments his children now find themselves in. His wife and him both advocate for his childrens’ place in a more diverse environment. How might his own upbringing in different countries impact the parenting principles he obliges to today?</p><br>

        </h4><br>
        <p class = "header-content">Jamie immigrated to China in 2004 as an English teacher, where she later met Peng, her husband. Her own parents continue to live in Scotland, where she grew up. Having experienced the immigration process twice in her life, she has plenty of knowledge on what it’s like settling in potentially unfamiliar land. How do these experiences impact the third-culture life her and her kids are experiencing?</p>

        </h4><br>
        <p class = "header-content">Nicholas, age 10, Isabella, age 9, and Eva, age 7, all immigrated to Canada in July 2022. Despite having lived most of their lives in China, when asked if they felt more ‘Chinese’ or ‘Canadian', all three answered that they felt more Canadian. Furthermore, their parents described the three’s transition into Canada as easy and without problem. Could this be because of their schooling at an International institution in China? How might the impacts of immigrating to a different country at a young age change over time? </p>
